# 3D Combat Game: Enhancing Game AI with Machine Learning
## CIS-693 (Master's Project) @ GVSU with Prof. DeVries

The goal of this project is create a 3D combat/shooter game. The game will feature two teams competing against each other, and the player will be on one of those teams. The game mode will feature conquest points that teams can capture, which also serve as respawn points. There will only be so many tickets available to each team, and the first team to hit 500 tickets will win. Incrementing the ticket counter will be tied to the number of conquest points that a team holds. Additionally, some Machine Learning is planned to be implemented so that the bots can learn to make some of their own decisions. Some of those decisions may include the bots learning which points to attack/defend, where to respawn, where to navigate to on the map (when not attacking/defending a point), and how/when to attack nearby enemy entities. There is also a plan to utilize principles from Software Engineering for tasks such as drafting requirements, and assuming time permits, the Cloud might be implemented for hosting save files. Furthermore, if the cloud is utilized, then post-match game data could be sent to it, which would allow for additional opportunities for the bots to learn more scenarios based on training data from other players.
