Updated the orchestrator to not consider enemy or neutral post changes. Instead, the orchestrator is concerned with
satisfying accomplishing its team's required posts in the desired state.

Changes during V5 training:
	* Epoch  94 -> Testing to take only the top 1 state
	* Epoch  95 -> Testing to take oply the top 20% of states
	* Epoch 120 -> Reverted the above changes
	* Epoch 321 -> Optimized grabbing the next best state
	* Epoch 393 -> Rsolved an error for not setting the correct previous state value during back-propagation
	* Epoch 438 -> Update to not grab applicable states where the smart team doesn't adavnce to the next point set, but the enemy does
	* Epoch 451 -> Revert above
