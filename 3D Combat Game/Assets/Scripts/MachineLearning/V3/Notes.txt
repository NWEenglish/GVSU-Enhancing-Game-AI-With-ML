This new version, v3, is meant to help resolve the widening gap in the win-loss for smart bots. As a basic bot team, 
Red Team had the advantage. Since becoming smart, they've seem to of thrown out that advantage by targeting the enemy
command posts at the start, rather than aqcuiring the nearest ones first. That's not to say they don't, but half the 
team shouldn't be targeting the furthest post on most games. It should've learned by now that that's a failing tactic. 
This version does three main things:
	1) Remove ordering states by orders of magnitude. Instead it will use strict values for a state. The original idea
		of magnitude was to prevent the worst case scenario by assigning bots to prevent it, but that seems to be 
		failing.
	2) Introduce state rewards. Ordinarily, we might use -1 for a new state, which encourages completing the task 
		quicker. It will be used here, however, to encourage widening the gap between the two teams. Letting the game 
		be won by a few points is risky, it should be attempting to "obliterate" it's enemy.
